# Student-Database-management system.
The Student Database Management System is a database project designed to manage  student information in an educational institution.  Many schools and training centers still rely on manual or poorly organized systems to store  student records, which leads to data duplication, inconsistency, and difficulty in accessing  information.
## 🛠️ Tools Used
- MySQL  
- SQL (Structured Query Language)  
- MySQL Workbench  
- GitHub  
- ER Diagram Tool (Draw.io or Lucidchart)

## 📌 Problem Statement
Educational institutions need a reliable way to store and manage student information such as personal details, enrollment data, and academic programs.  

Without a structured database system, institutions face challenges such as:  

- Duplicate student records  
- Difficulty updating student information  
- Poor data organization  
- Slow retrieval of student details  

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to design a well-structured database that solves these problems using proper database design principles.
## 📋 Project Questions / Tasks

---

### 1️⃣ Database Model
- Explain the relational database model and why it is suitable for managing student data.  
- Compare it with other database models such as:
  - Hierarchical model  
  - Network model  

---

### 2️⃣ Entities, Relationships, and Attributes
- Identify the main entities involved in a Student Database Management System.  
- Define their attributes and relationships.  
- Draw an Entity Relationship (ER) diagram showing:
  - Primary keys  
  - Relationships  

---

### 3️⃣ Normalization
Initially, all student information is stored in a single table that includes:
- Student details  
- Department information  
- Enrollment year  

#### Tasks:
- Explain the problems with this design.  
- Explain the importance of normalization.  
- Normalize the database up to **Third Normal Form (3NF)** and show all steps.
